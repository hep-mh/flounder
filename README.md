## Installation & Usage

The web version of Flounder can be freely accessed at [``timer.hep-mh.com``](https://timer.hep-mh.com/). Feel free to use it on your platform of choice, as it works on mobile and desktop. In fact, Flounder even is a full-fledged PWA and can thus be installed as such.

*Alternatively, there also exist native versions for various platforms, which are discussed in the following:*

### **Android**

The ``.apk`` file for Android can be downloaded [here](https://hep-mh.com/files/packages/flounder-latest-android.apk). After downloading, make sure to allow installation form unknown sources in your settings. And for your own security, turn it back off once you are done.

*Publication on F-Droid is on the Roadmap.*

### **Linux**

A ``.flatpak`` file for any x86_64 Linux system can be downloaded [here](https://hep-mh.com/files/packages/flounder-latest-linux-x86_64.flatpak). After downloading, first install the Freedesktop platform via the command (also make sure that flatpak is currently configured on your system. For more information, check [https://flatpak.org/setup/](https://flatpak.org/setup/).)
```
flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform/x86_64/21.08
```
Afterwards, the previously downloaded package can be installed at user-level via
```
flatpak install --user flounder-latest-linux-x86_64.flatpak
```

*Publication on Flathub is on the Roadmap.*

A ``.zip`` files with precombiled binaries for x86_64 Windows 7/9/10/11 can be downloaded [here](https://hep-mh.com/files/packages/flounder-latest-windows-x86_64.zip). After downloading, unpack the file and double-click on ``flounder.exe`` in the previously created directory.

A standard installer in ``.exe`` format can be downloaded [here](https://hep-mh.com/files/packages/flounder-latest-windows-x86_64-setup.exe). After downloading, double-click the file and proceed with the installation process.

### **macOS/iOS**

Currently, there do not exist any builds for macOS and  iOS, as I simply lack access to a macOS device, which is needed to build for these platforms. There might be a native version for macOS in the future, but since Apple does not allow sideloading on iOS (and I will not pay the money to upload it to the App Store), the future looks a lot less promising for iOS. **However, even on these platforms, you can simply use the web version.**
