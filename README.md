# Installation & Usage

The web version of Flounder can be freely accessed at [``timer.hep-mh.com``](https://timer.hep-mh.com/). Feel free to use it on your platform of choice, as it works on mobile and desktop. In fact, Flounder even is a full-fledged PWA and can thus be installed as such.

Alternatively, I also compiled native versions for ``Linux``, ``Windows``, and ``Android``. Feel free to grab them from my website at [``hep-mh.com``](https://hep-mh.com/). Currently, there do not exist any builds for ``macOS`` and  ``iOS``, as I simply lack access to a ``macOS`` device. There might be a native version for ``macOS`` in the future, but since Apple does not allow sideloading on ``iOS`` (and I will not pay the money to upload it to the App Store), the future looks a lot less promising for ``iOS``. **However, even on these platforms, you can simply use the web version.**
